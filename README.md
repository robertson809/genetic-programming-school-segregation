# Genetic Programming to Reduce School Segregation
## Michael's Machine Reasoning Final Project

Lena Parker's (Davidson College class of 2017) thesis addressed the problem of reducing socioeconomic segregation in Charlottle-Meckelenburg Schools without
unreasonably increasing student commute times. Her linear programming approach struggled to run in a reasonable amount of time given the size of the problem, 
so we attempt to find a more efficient solution through genetic programming. Over 80 hours, our algorithm evolved solutions which improved upon the baseline 
fitness of random assignments by over 90\%.  Though our results require further analysis and verification before potential presentation to the CMS (Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools), the large relative improvement of our solutions in a comparatively short period of time demonstrates the promise of genetic programming in this problem space.
